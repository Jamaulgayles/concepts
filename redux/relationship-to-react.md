React is a library that applies a unidirectional data flow while rendering user interfaces based on changes in the virtual DOM. Redux is a library that manages application state and supports developer wellbeing by providing a consistent way to manage immutable state data. Neither of these libraries are dependent on each other, but they compliment each other wonderfully.
